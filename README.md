# Secure File Sharing Server
## Installing
1) Install Golang [here](https://golang.org/doc/install).
2) I recommend following the go path hierarchy so make sure that you know where your go path is. Reference [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH) 
for details.
3) Install the userlib for this file server by running: `go get github.com/ryanleh/cs161-p2/userlib`.
4) Clone the project to the following directory: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/Daniel-VDM`. Note that this can be done with 
the following command: `go get github.com/Daniel-VDM/Secure-File-Sharing-Server`.
5) You can run some test code for the server with the following command: `go run proj2.go`.
> This project is more meant to be a package that can be imported / used by some other program.
